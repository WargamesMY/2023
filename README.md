#### *Rules*

```text
We try hard to keep the competition as free and exciting as possible; however, we do require players to adhere to a few simple rules:

    1. Maximum of THREE(3) people per team.
    2. No off-the-shelf automated scanning tools such as Nessus, OpenVAS, etc. It's useless and we'll kick you out for that lame ass shit.
    3. No cooperation between players with independent accounts. Sharing of flags or providing revealing hints to other players is cheating, don't do it.
    4. No attacking the competition infrastructure. If bugs or vulns are found, please alert the competition organizers immediately
    5. No sabotaging of other competing players, or in any way hindering their independent progress.
    6. No brute forcing of challenge flag / keys against the scoring server
    7. No flooding and / or DoS attacks. Teams caught in the act will be penalized by a time penalty or a disqualification.
    8. No ARP spoofing. Teams caught in the act will be penalized by a time penalty or a disqualification.
    9. The rules and regulations will or might be updated without prior notice.
    10. At all times, the decision of the WGMY Crew is final on any matter in question.
